### Getting started

The first thing we need to do is write the smart contracts.

The marketplace will consist of two main smart contracts:

- NFT Contract for minting NFTs
- Markeplace contract for facilitating the sale of NFTs

For writing an NFT, we can use the [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard that is available via [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721).
